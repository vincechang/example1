## ‚ú® Features

### Home Page

1. **Keyword Search Input:**

    - Users can enter a keyword in a text input field.
    - The search button is enabled only when the text input is non-empty; it is disabled when the input is empty.
2. **Page Size Selection:**

    - Users can use a slider to select the number of results displayed per page.
3. **Search Button:**

    - Upon clicking the search button, users are directed to the results page.

### Results Page

1. **Search Results Display:**
    - Results are displayed in a card format.
    - Each card includes an image, title, and username.
    - If the keyword is empty, redirect to the home page.

### Friend Panel

1. **Responsive Display:**

    - The friend panel is displayed on both the home page and results page when the display width is greater than 1440px.

    - The friend panel includes two tabs: Followers and Following.

## üöß Pending Features / Improvements

    - Integrate with tags API to support loading more tags and infinite scrolling, and provide a skeleton loader.
3. **Results Page Load More Functionality:**

    - Implement a load more button or infinite scrolling using `useSWRInfinite` for the results page, with a skeleton loader.

    - Allow the `ManyComponentsSkeleton` to accept `pageSize` as a parameter to configure the number of items displayed.
5. **Result Card Component Extraction:**

    - Refactor the results display to extract a reusable result card component.

3. **Result Page Row Gap:**

    - The row gap between results on the result page is inconsistent.

## üöÄ Usage

2. Use the slider to select the desired page size.
3. Click the search button to view results on the results page.
4. Explore the friend panel if your display width is greater than 1440px.
5. Use the navigation bar to switch between the home page and tags page (when implemented).
